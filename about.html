      <h2>About MASEKO Cape Town</h2>

      <!-- <p class="p1">
        MASEKO Cape Town is a proudly South African fashion brand founded by Sello
        Maseko, a young designer and entrepreneur from Elandskraal (7 Staad) in Marble
        Hall, Limpopo, now based in Cape Town. The brand was born from adversity,
        raised on passion, and crafted with purpose.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">
        The journey began in 2011, two years after Sello lost his father. With no school bag
        and no resources, he hand-stitched his first creation — a bag made from a 10kg rice
        sack, carefully measured using an A4 book. That moment of necessity sparked a
        lifelong purpose: to use creativity as a tool for survival, identity, and empowerment.
        <span>
          “After finishing the bag and hand-stitching every detail, I felt something shift —
          I regained my confidence. That moment taught me the deeper value of
          clothing: when you wear something that fits you well, you carry yourself differently.
          You walk with purpose. You feel seen. That lesson never left me —
          and it’s the heart of what MASEKO Cape Town stands for today.”
        </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p3">
        Through high school, Sello became known for his tailoring skills, trusted by
        classmates and teachers alike. After matriculating in 2019, he relocated to Cape
        Town, where he worked behind the scenes with professional tailors and contributed
        to garments worn by high-profile clients — even if his name wasn’t on the label yet.
      </p>

      <p class="p4">
        In 2023, he launched <strong>MASEKO Cape Town</strong>, a brand built on hard work, heritage,
        and a vision to bring custom fashion to life for clients who value individuality,
        excellence, and story-driven design.
      </p> -->

      <p>MASEKO Cape Town is more than a fashion label, it is a story of resilience, craftsmanship, and African excellence. Founded by Sello Maseko, a designer and tailor originally from Zebediela, Limpopo, the brand reflects a deep passion for quality, identity, and storytelling through fashion.</p>

    <p>Sello’s journey began in high school, offering basic alterations and garment repairs within his community. His talent and work ethic quickly earned him trust from schoolmates to teachers even becoming a personal tailor to several local clients. After completing matric in 2019, he continued refining his skills and vision.</p>

    <p>In 2022, Sello relocated to Cape Town, where he gained valuable hands-on experience working behind the scenes with established tailors. During this time, he contributed to the design and production of garments worn by high-profile clients and public figures while his name wasn’t always on the label, his craftsmanship spoke loudly in every stitch.</p>

    <p>To deepen his knowledge and refine his techniques, Sello enrolled in one of Cape Town’s leading fashion institutions, combining academic learning with years of real-world experience. This balance of formal education and practical mastery gave birth to <strong>MASEKO Cape Town</strong> a brand built not only on talent but also on vision, discipline, and purpose.</p>

    <p>Today, MASEKO Cape Town stands as a growing force in South African fashion offering custom garments, alterations, and original designs that honour both the client and the craft. Each piece is personal, intentional, and made to fit more than just the body — it’s made to fit your story.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p >
        To create garments that are more than clothes they’re statements of pride, identity,
        and resilience. We aim to deliver exceptional quality and fit while building a platform
        that empowers others through fashion. We design, restore, and tailor clothing that
        makes people feel seen, confident, and proud. We don’t just sew garments we
        heal them.
      </p>

      <p>
        From custom creations that reflect identity and purpose, to precise alterations that
        restore confidence and comfort, we act as a clothes doctor giving new life to what
        you wear, stitch by stitch.
      </p>
